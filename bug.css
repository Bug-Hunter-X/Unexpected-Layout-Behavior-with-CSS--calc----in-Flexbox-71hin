The CSS property `calc()` is used incorrectly causing unexpected layout.  For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` inside a flexbox container where the 100% refers to the parent container's width and not the available space within the flexbox itself, resulting in incorrect element sizing. Another example is attempting to perform calculations that involve different units without proper conversion, like mixing `px` and `em` without a clear conversion strategy.
